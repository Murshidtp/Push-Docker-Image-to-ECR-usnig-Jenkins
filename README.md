# Push Docker Image to AWS ECR with Jenkins Pipeline

This project demonstrates the process of creating a simple Python Flask application, building a Docker image, and pushing the image to AWS ECR using a Jenkins pipeline.

## Overview

The project follows the steps below:

1. **Python Flask App**: A basic Python Flask application has been created to showcase the workflow.

2. **Docker Image Build**: The application is containerized using Docker. The Dockerfile is included in the repository to define the image.

3. **Jenkins Pipeline**: An automated CI/CD pipeline is implemented using Jenkins. The pipeline script (Jenkinsfile) orchestrates the build, test, and deployment processes.

4. **AWS ECR Deployment**: The Docker image is pushed to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for storage and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools and accounts set up:

- Python installed on your machine.
- Docker installed on your machine.
- Jenkins installed and configured.
- AWS account with ECR repository created.
- Git for version control
